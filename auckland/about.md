**Note: Applications for ResBaz 2018 are now closed. Thank you to all who applied to be part of this event!**

The Research Bazaar is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy emerging at the center of modern research. Throughout 2018, events will be held at a number of university campuses around the globe.

Hosted by the University of Auckland, the 2018 Auckland Research Bazaar is a (free-of-charge) 3-day intensive conference where researchers come together to up-skill in ‘next generation digital research tools and skills’. In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun!<br><br> Who should attend? Researchers at ALL levels from ALL disciplines. PhD and research Masters students are especially encouraged to apply. Research technologists who support researchers to do their job should also come along! Sessions at ResBaz this year are intended to offer a brief practical introduction to a broad selection of topics and tools related to digital research practice relevant across the disciplines. ResBaz 2018 will be followed by software carpentry workshops on 12 and 13 July.<br><br>
