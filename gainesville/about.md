The Gainesville Research Bazaar is a 3-day workshop/conference hybrid where participants come together to learn, share knowledge and skills, and meet people doing data science and research across the UF campus.

In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun!
